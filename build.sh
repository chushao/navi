# Cryptographic verification confirms the artifact was built by this repo's CI

Navi: skipping build-provenance attestation — the attestation API could not be
reached or the request was not authorized (an auth or network issue, not a
problem with the downloaded file). Falling back to the SHA-256 checksum match,
which already passed.

gh reported:
$ATT_OUT

Manual check:
  gh attestation verify "$TMP/$ZIP_NAME" --owner "$OWNER"
EOF
    else
        cat >&2 <<EOF

Navi install aborted: build-provenance attestation verification FAILED.

The SHA-256 matched checksums.txt, but the artifact's attestation could not be
verified — this can indicate a tampered release. SHA-256 alone can't protect you
here: an attacker who swaps the artifact can also swap checksums.txt.
